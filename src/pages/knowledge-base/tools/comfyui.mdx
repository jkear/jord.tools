# ComfyUI

## Quick Overview
ComfyUI is a powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI with a graph/nodes interface. It allows you to design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using a flowchart-based interface.

## My Experience
ComfyUI is my primary tool for generative image workflows. The node-based architecture allows for incredible control over the generation process, from ControlNets to IP-Adapters.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Installation command
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
cd ComfyUI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
