# TensorFlow

## Quick Overview
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

## My Experience
I have used TensorFlow for various production-grade machine learning models, leveraging its robust deployment capabilities like TensorFlow Serving and TFLite.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Installation command
pip install tensorflow
```
